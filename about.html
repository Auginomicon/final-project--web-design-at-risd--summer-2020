      <div>Education</div>
      <div>I Graduated from Stockton University with a Bachelors of Arts Degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. Despite graduating I still take courses online to further my knowledge on many computer science topics. In addition, I have purchased many Udemy courses to help me btter learn Game Development in softwares such as Unreal Engine, Unity, and Gamemaker Studios 2. Plus, some courses to help me learn how to draw art and use Blender.</div>

   <div>Self</div>
   <div>My full name is August Dae Cassin, but you can call me Augie! I am a passionate, understanding, kind, down to earth type of person. I love to learn about new things and listen. I always try to do my best on everything that I do and I always want to get better. </div>
   <div> I was born in South Korea and was adopted when I was an infant. I flew to America, more specifically, New Jeresy where my adopted family welcomed me with loving arms. I then grew up and was raised here in Southern Jersey. When I was a child, I loved to create things with Legos and world build. As I was in high school, I was contemplating on what I should do and what career path I should take. When going to college, my first major was Biology; however, I did not like it as much as I thought I would. So, I moved on to Sociology/Anthropolgy despite liking it, I felt that the careers that came from this were not things I would want to do for the rest of my life. In the end, I did Computer Science and Information Systems and completely loved it. I now, try my best to learn as much as I can about it and combine it with my love of video games.</div>
